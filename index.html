  <h2>About the Project</h2>

  <h3>Vision 2030 and Innovation</h3>
  <p>
    Vision 2030 is Saudi Arabia’s strategic plan to diversify its economy, reduce reliance on oil, and build a vibrant society powered by innovation. Central to this plan is the integration of advanced technologies like Augmented Reality (AR) into various sectors including tourism, education, and infrastructure.
  </p>

  <h3>Augmented Reality in Saudi Tourism</h3>
  <p>
    AR is revolutionizing how tourists explore Saudi Arabia. Visitors can use mobile apps or smart glasses to experience interactive overlays at ancient sites like Al-Ula, Diriyah, and Mada’in Saleh. These digital reconstructions allow users to witness historical events, view ancient structures in their original forms, and access historical insights in real time.
  </p>

  <h3>Smart Cities and NEOM</h3>
  <p>
    NEOM, a futuristic megacity under development as part of Vision 2030, will integrate AR into daily life. From smart navigation and real-time assistance to virtual shopping and entertainment, AR will play a crucial role in building one of the world’s most technologically advanced cities.
  </p>

  <h3>Interactive Urban Experiences</h3>
  <p>
    AR is being used in major cities like Riyadh and Jeddah to create smart tourism experiences. Through AR-guided walking tours, visitors can access real-time facts about landmarks, explore architectural styles, and view cultural stories layered over their physical surroundings.
  </p>

  <h3>AR in Museums and Heritage Sites</h3>
  <p>
    Saudi museums and historical exhibitions are adopting AR to bring artifacts to life. Visitors can interact with 3D models, watch animations explaining cultural traditions, and even participate in immersive storytelling experiences that transform traditional exhibits into interactive adventures.
  </p>

  <h3>Education Powered by AR</h3>
  <p>
    AR is helping modernize the Kingdom’s educational system. Students can explore 3D models in science classes, witness historical battles unfold in history lessons, and visualize complex systems in biology and physics. This supports Vision 2030’s goal of making education more engaging and future-ready.
  </p>

  <h3>Economic Growth Through Tech-Driven Tourism</h3>
  <p>
    The tourism sector is projected to contribute 10% to Saudi Arabia’s GDP by 2030. AR enhances tourism by offering rich, personalized, and innovative experiences. From virtual desert safaris to interactive heritage trails, these technologies attract global attention and stimulate sustainable growth.
  </p>

  <h3>Preserving Heritage While Embracing the Future</h3>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates how AR bridges the gap between tradition and technology. It preserves Saudi Arabia’s rich cultural heritage while presenting it in modern, accessible formats — aligning perfectly with the goals of Vision 2030.
